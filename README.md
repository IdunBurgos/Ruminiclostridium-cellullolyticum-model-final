# Ruminiclostridium cellullolyticum H10 model

This is the code for the reconstruction, testing and curation of the R. cellulolyticum strain H10.

The `notebooks` folder contains the following steps:

- **Part 1**: Build draft model with CarveMe
- **Part 2**: Create pathways for lignocellulose degradation
- **Part 3**: Manual curation of different pathways
- **Part 4**: Calibration of GAM and NGAM 
- **Part 5**: Fix cross references for metabolites, reactions, and genes
- **Part 6**: Test the model with experimental data 
- **Part 7**: Simulation of cellulose batch culture (with experimental results)
- **Part 8**: Simulation of arbabinoxylan batch culture
